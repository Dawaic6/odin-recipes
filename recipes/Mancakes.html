    <h2>Discription</h2>

    <p>
        Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully. <br>
         We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all,<br>
          so it wasn't that big of a shock. <br>
          The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk <br>
          well rewarded.
    </p>
    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
<li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
<li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
<li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
<li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
<li>1 cup warm maple syrup, or to taste</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
</ul>
<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, <br>
    stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. <br>
     Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, <br>
      1 to 2 minutes.
     Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.</li>
<li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and <br>
    cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. <br>
    Add drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, <br>
    and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until batter is smooth. <br>
    Let batter rest for 10 minutes.

</li>
<li>Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; <br>
    whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
<li>Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and <br>
    1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. <br>
    Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form <br>
    and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. <br>
    Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. <br>
    Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to plate and top with maple syrup.</li>
</ol>
